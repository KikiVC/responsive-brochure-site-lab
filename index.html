              <h2>Alice In Chains - "Facelift"</h2>
              <p>
                Facelift, in 1990, was the first grunge album to leave an
                impression on the charts (thanks to the success of Man In The
                Box), paving the way for Nevermind, Ten and Badmotorfinger, all
                of which followed AIC’s debut up the charts in the ensuing
                months. To many, Facelift only hinted at the band’s potential
                and the real gem is 1992’s dark classic, Dirt.

              <h2>Mudhoney - "Superfuzz Bigmuff"</h2>
              <p>
                Originally an EP, this took its name from two guitar effects
                pedals that would come to help shape the sound of grunge: the
                Univox Super-Fuzz and the Electro-Harmonix Big Muff. Like many
                great records, it sold poorly at first but was a crucial
                influence on others, including Kurt Cobain, who named it in his
                top 50 albums of all-time.

              <span>(1991)</span>
              <h2>Nirvana - "Nevermind"</h2>
              <p>
                Ask anyone which record is most synonymous with grunge, and the
                answer will probably be Nirvana’s landmark Nevermind. That
                Nevermind includes Smells Like Teen Spirit – the song that
                single-handedly ignited grunge – is reason enough for the
                album’s ‘essential’ status, but elsewhere on it the hits just
                keep coming: Come As You Are, Lithium, In Bloom. Also, Nevermind
                popularised the now done-to-death quiet/raging-chorus style of
                songwriting.

              <h2>Hole - "Live Through This"</h2>
              <p>
                The second album from the legendary grunge group, it was
                controversially released just a week after the death of
                frontwoman Courtney Love’s husband Kurt Cobain. Dealing with
                female issues such as motherhood, postnatal depression and
                violence against women, the album was instantly hailed as a
                classic, being both scruffy, and unrefined, yet full of hooks.

              <h2>Pearl Jam - "Ten"</h2>
              <p>
                Although Pearl Jam eventually rejected the mainstream, the
                band’s best album is also their most commercial: their
                magnificent debut, Ten. Instead of wallowing in misery following
                the demise of their band Mother Love Bone after the death of its
                singer, guitarist Stone Gossard and bassist Jeff Ament put
                together Pearl Jam, a much more back-to-basics unit.

              <h2>Soundgarden - "Badmotorfinger"</h2>
              <p>
                Along with The Melvins, Soundgarden were one of the first
                Seattle bands to specialise in slow, murky riffs, and in Chris
                Cornell they had one of the best singers operating in the genre.
                By the time their third full-length album came along, 1991’s
                Badmotorfinger, the band had transformed into an adventurous
                outfit.
